This repository provides a Python implementation of face recognition using OpenCV and the face_recognition library. The implementation can detect and recognize faces in an input image by comparing them with known individuals' facial features. Following are the images currently used in this repository:

## Getting Started

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries using the following command:
   
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python face-recognition numpy
   ```

2. Run the `face_recognition.py` script:

   ```bash
   python face_recognition.py
   ```

3. The script will process the random image from Gallery, perform face recognition, and display an output image with recognized face labeled.
